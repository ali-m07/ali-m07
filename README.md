## About Me

PhD candidate in Futures Studies, Solution Architect by practice. I started in electrical engineering labs writing C, but found my groove where systems, people, and data collide. These days I architect infra stacks end to end—Python automation, Jira ecosystems, CI/CD, observability—and thread foresight thinking through every pipeline so businesses can move with confidence. I build bridges between future scenarios and the infrastructure that has to survive them.

```python
from datetime import datetime

class AliMansouri:
    def __init__(self):
        self.expertise = ["python", "ci/cd", "jira", "cloud", "foresight"]
        self.energy = "⚡"
        self.pipeline = []

    def futureproof(self, idea):
        ticket = f"{idea}@{datetime.utcnow().isoformat()}Z"
        self.pipeline.append(ticket)
        return f"🚀 shipping {idea} | reliability >= 99%"

    def coffee(self):
        return "☕ strategic optimism"

ali = AliMansouri()
print(ali.futureproof("next-gen ops brain"))
```
